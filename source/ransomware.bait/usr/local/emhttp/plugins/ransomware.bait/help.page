---<br><br>This detection plugin creates so-called "bait" files either within all folders of a share or only within the root rolder of each share (note that any appdata folder is specifically excluded)  If those files should change (ie: become encrypted) or if they are deleted/renamed (which seems to be how most ransomware malware operates), then SMB will be immediately stopped to prevent further encryption to your files)<br>In the unlikely event of a naming conflict between the bait files and pre-existing files already on the array, the original files will not be touched, and they will not be monitored for changes<br><br>
